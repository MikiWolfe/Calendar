## Hourly Planner 

We have been tasked with making a day planner for to cover business hours for our client. We are using local storage to store user input so it is available for them at a later time.  We are using moment so the current date will be displayed when the page is opened. We are also using moment to keep track of the current time so when the user opens the page they are able to see the past time is grey, the current hour is red, and the future hours are green.  

## Things I learned:
    - Click events to local storage are challenging.  
    - Moment () is a game changer and so neat to learn. 
    - jQuery is really interesting and I really liked using it for this project.
